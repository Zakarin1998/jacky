## 🧩 1. Data Gathering

Here’s a structured plan to conduct a deep-dive study for the JCD pool and ecosystem—considering the newly referenced “jchandollar.vip” website and specific metrics:

---
### a) On‑chain Pool Data

* **Depth & Liquidity Composition**: Pull granular snapshots from Uniswap V4/JCD–ETH pool (ticks, current √Price, liquidity distribution).
* **Swap history & MEV activity**: Analyze swap events for slippage, price impact, and bot‑like patterns (e.g., sandwich sequences).
* **Token Supply**: Confirm 11 M minted, 8 M burned, \~3 M still circulating. Off‑chain, 1.5 M in old LP, 2 M with you → \~1.5 M external holders. Good for understanding token concentration.

### b) Off‑chain Info / Community Sentiment

* **“jchandollar.vip” site**: Investigate tokenomics – are there details on vesting, burn events, ownership, governance plans? ([jchandollar.vip][1], [gov.uniswap.org][2])
* **Historical context**: Being “First tradable coin on Uniswap” may give it heritage value—evaluate brand/community attachment ([bitcointalk.org][3]).
* **Market data**: Collate CEX listings (if any); community chatter; decentralized exchange activity outside JCD/ETH pool.

## 📊 2. Analytical & Simulation Framework

### a) MEV / Slippage Simulation

* Identify typical swap sizes that trigger price jumps beyond tick boundaries.
* Emulate sandwich scenarios incorporating real gas costs.
* Estimate **MEV profits vs LP revenue**, to find optimal fee vs slippage thresholds.

### b) Dynamic fees optimization

* Model various fee curves (e.g., 0.3% base + surcharge when price deviates >X% from oracle).
* Backtest using historical swap data to evaluate revenue volatility and bot deterrence.

### c) Range‑strategy analysis

* Given token concentration, test how range width of liquidity affects IL vs fee revenue across scenarios (bull run, massive sell-off).
* Factor in LP behavior: will major holders reposition, or will you design “static” vs “active” range strategies?

## 🔧 3. Hook Logic Simulation

* Define `beforeSwap` triggers: e.g., if swap > Y% price impact, raise fee or revert.
* Incorporate an oracle call: if on‑chain price >±X% off oracle price, apply restrictions.
* Simulate in local environment using forked mainnet + dummy hook logic.

---

## 🧪 4. User & Governance Study

* **LP incentives**: Survey holders (external \~1.5 M tokens) to understand their risk appetite, gas tolerance, expectations.
* **DAO governance framework**: Study if holders are ready to vote on parameters: fee tiers, thresholds, oracle selection.
* **Governance token model**: Is JCD itself going to be the governance token? Use on‑chain data from site to confirm token controls.

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Web Audit** – Relist site information (`jchandollar.vip`) and extract tokenomics, burn schedule, supply control details.
2. **Fetch on‑chain data** – Use tools like The Graph, Etherscan, and Uniswap subgraph to collect pool history and metrics.
3. **Develop simulation scripts** – Python/JS scripts that model price impact, fees, MEV, and compare outcomes across scenarios.
4. **Design hook strategies** – Build pseudocode for fee modulation, price validation, and define oracle integration.
5. **Governance framing** – Propose how DAO voting can adjust hook parameters, oracle addresses, and fee schedules post deployment.
